## Overview

### Lessons

1. Learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Project

-

## Procedural Programming

- uses procedures or functions that do particular things
- one function may lead to another function and so on

## Object-Oriented Programming

- model real-life object with what it has and what it can do
- split larger tasks into several, reusable pieces
- attributes: what an object has
- methods: what an object does

### Classes

- blueprint or type

### Objects

- individual object generated from a class

```python
car = CarBlueprint()

# car = object
# Car = class
```
