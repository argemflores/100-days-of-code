## Overview

### Lessons

1. Namespaces and scope

### Project

- The Number Guessing Game ðŸ”®

## Local scope

- variables, functions, and other objects are accessible within code block (e.g. functions)

## Global scope

- variables, functions, and other objects are accessible across all the code

```py
# Global scope
player_health = 10

def game():
    def drink_potion():
        # Local scope
        potion_strength = 2
        print(potion_strength)
        print(player_health)

    drink_potion()

# print(potion_strength)
print(player_health)
game()
```

```shell
10
2
10
```

## Block scope does not exist

- variable is still accessible outside a code block where it is defined (e.g. if statement, for loop)

```py
game_level = 3

def create_enemy():
    enemies = ["Skeleton", "Zombie", "Alien"]

    if game_level < 5:
        new_enemy = enemies[0]

    # still accessible
    print(new_enemy)

create_enemy()
```

```shell
Skeleton
```

## Modify a global variable

- use `global` to declare a variable inside a local scope
- this is not recommended because it is confusing and more prone to errors
- simply return the value of the updated variable instead

```python
enemies = 1

def increase_enemies():
    # not recommended because it's confusing and more prone to errors
    global enemies
    enemies += 1
    print(f"enemies inside function: {enemies}")
    # just return the new value

increase_enemies()
print(f"enemies inside function: {enemies}")
```

```shell
enemies inside function: 2
enemies inside function: 2
```

## Global constants

- global variables that are never going to change
- formatted in all uppercase characters separated by underscores

```python
PI = 3.1416
GOOGLE_URL = 'https://www.google.com/'
TWITTER_HANDLE = '@argemflores'
```
