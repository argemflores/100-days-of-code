## Overview

### Lessons

1. Code blocks
1. Functions
1. While Loops

### Project

- Karel, The Robot ðŸ¤–

## Functions

- code block that does something
- can be called multiple times
- makes code more manageable, reusable and readable

```py
def my_function():
    # do this
    # then do this
    # finally do this

my_function()
```

## While loop

- loop that will continue to run while the condition is true
- infinite loop occurs when condition remains true always, thus not stopping

```py
while condition_is_true:
    # do something repeatedly
```
