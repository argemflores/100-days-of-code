2. Logical operators
3. Code blocks
4. Scope

### Project

- Choose Your Own Adventure ðŸ‘‘

## Conditionals

- if condition is true, execute code block

```py
if condition:
    # do this
else:
    # do that
```

```py
water_level = 50

if water_level > 80:
    print("Drain water")
else:
    print("Continue")
```

## Code blocks

- indented code/s

## Comparison operators

- `==` equal
- `!=` not equal
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `<=` less than or equal

## Modulo

- `%` calculates for the remainder after dividing one number by another

```py
8 % 2 # returns 0
9 % 2 # returns 1
```
